### Key Components

#### Chess Engine (`chess/` package)
- **Board**: Bitboard-based representation for efficient move generation
- **MoveValidator**: Complete implementation of chess rules with legal move generation
- **GameState**: FEN notation support, move history, and game result tracking

#### Engine Integration (`engine/` package)
- **UCI Protocol**: Full UCI specification support for professional engines
- **Process Management**: Safe engine lifecycle management with cleanup
- **Binary Extraction**: Automatic extraction of engine binaries from assets

#### User Interface (`ui/` package)
- **ChessBoard**: Custom Canvas-based board with GPU acceleration
- **Touch Handling**: Multi-touch support with drag-and-drop animations
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layouts for phones, tablets, and foldables

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Android Studio**: Arctic Fox or later (recommended: latest stable)
- **Android SDK**: API 24+ (Android 7.0+)
- **Kotlin**: 1.9.0+
- **Gradle**: 8.2+

### Engine Binaries

The app requires chess engine binaries in `app/src/main/assets/engines/`:

#### LeelaChess0 (lc0)
```bash
# Download ARM64 binary for Android
# Place as: app/src/main/assets/engines/lc0
# Make executable: chmod +x app/src/main/assets/engines/lc0
```

#### Stockfish
```bash
# Download ARM64 binary for Android
# Place as: app/src/main/assets/engines/stockfish
# Make executable: chmod +x app/src/main/assets/engines/stockfish
```

**Note**: Engine binaries must be ARM64 architecture for Android compatibility.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ChessTrainer
```

### 2. Engine Setup
```bash
# Create engines directory
mkdir -p app/src/main/assets/engines

# Download and place engine binaries
# lc0 and stockfish ARM64 binaries required
```

### 3. Build the App
```bash
# Generate Gradle wrapper (if needed)
gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.2

# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Build release APK
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

### 4. Run on Device
```bash
# Install debug build
./gradlew installDebug

# Or use Android Studio: Run > Run 'app'
